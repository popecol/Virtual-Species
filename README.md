This repository contains full code in R supporting our publication: <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14176>, in which we describe a method for generating virtual species by reverse engineering of spatiotemporal ecological models. By combining virtual species with an observational process, virtual ecologist data are generated that change both spatially and temporally, in a way that resembles patterns generated in ecological studies. For the purpose of the publication, we have also prepared a short presentation of the method's performance in a form of two vignettes.

The study is supported by the National Science Centre, Poland, grant no. 2018/29/B/NZ8/00066 and the Pozna≈Ñ Supercomputing and Networking Centre (grant no. 403).
