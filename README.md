<h2>Virtual-Species</h2>

This repository contains full code in R supporting the publication, in which we describe a method for generating virtual species by reverse engineering of spatiotemporal ecological models. By combining virtual species with an observational process, virtual ecologist data are generated that change both spatially and temporally, in a way that resembles patterns generated in ecological studies. For the purpose of the publication, we have also prepared a short presentation of the method's performance in a form of vignette.

<h4>Instructions</h4>

1.	Download the ‘Virtual-Species’ repository 
2.	Download data necessary for the analysis as one compressed folder: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7061476,  
    or each file separately: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7017179
3.	Create a 'data' directory in the main repository folder and place all data files there 
4.	Set the main repository folder as a working directory 
5.	Ready to work!
